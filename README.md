<h1>Rumbling 20's Remake</h1>

![Title](Images/Cattura.PNG) </br>
It's my own complete version of [Rumbling 20's](https://github.com/ThrustWorld/Rumbling20-s). </br>
In the updated version, I decided to refactor the entire old project to improve the code readability and the software performance. </br>

Above all, I worked on: </br>
- A complete menu section(Play, Settings, Credits, Quit,...); </br>
- A score system influenced by obstacles and distance; </br>
- Fix audio system with a valuable one; </br>
- Add a saving sytem; </br>
- Implement a better pooling system. </br>

If you prefer, you can directly find the build on [Itch.io](https://thrustworld.itch.io/rumbling-20s-remake) too.
